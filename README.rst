pwman is a commandline based password manager. It encrypts the password database file using strong AES-256 encryption.

pwman has support for the following things:

* Store arbitrary attributes and text data along with the passwords and login credentials.
* Generate two factor authentication tokens (`TOTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm>`_).
* Database search with Regular Expressions or SQL LIKE syntax.
* Database compare (diff). In pwman prompt, at pwman command line and as `git diff` extension.
* Shell-style Tab-completion for all commands.
* Custom Python scripts for arbitrary database processing.
* Export of the complete database as SQL text dump, CSV dump and human readable plain text dump.

Install pwman
=============

pwman does not have to be installed. The `pwman` script can be run directly from the source tree.

However if you want to install pwman, it can be done either directly from the source tree by running the following commands:

.. code:: sh

	./setup.py build
	sudo -i  # Or any other command to become root
	./setup.py install

Or it can be installed vi `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_ by running the following commands:

Using a custom script to process the database content

A custom Python script can be passed to `pwman` as command line option. Such a script can do anything to the content of the database.
